# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles repo.

The setup is currently mostly for OSX, although many tools/config files are environment agnostic.

If you want to copy it, feel free!

# Todo

## Config

* OSX defaults

## Install

* Brew
* git
* Composer
* Yarn/node
* Go
* hub
* Phpstorm
* Atom
* FileZilla
* Chrome
* FireFox
* Spotify
* vagrant
* drush
* drupal console
* Platform.sh

## Improvements

* Make .gitconfig_work more general!
* Pull grep options out into environment variable?
* Clean out unused aliases
* Comment EVERYTHING
    * .inputrc
