# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles repo.

The setup is currently mostly for OSX, although many tools/config files are environment agnostic.

If you want to copy it, feel free!

# Todo

## Install

* Phpstorm
* Atom
* FileZilla
* Chrome
* FireFox
* Spotify

* vagrant
* docker
* Platform.sh

## Improvements

* Make .gitconfig_work more general!
* Pull grep options out into environment variable?
* Clean out unused aliases
* Comment EVERYTHING
    * .inputrc
* Harvest nice functions from people
    * https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.functions
    * http://nparikh.org/notes/zshrc.txt
* Add some more terminal auto-completions?
* Have a poke through /usr/local/bin for more things to load through package managers
* Update $PATH to use brew php version by default, then allow overriding with others (like MAMP PRO) if needed
